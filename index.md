# Some other things.
When I am not busy familirizing myself with obscure notions of physics, I sometimes dabble in making art, I mainly make Digital arts, Comics and Paintings, and if I don't want to do any of the above things, I sometimes take refuge in the world of nonacademic readings. You can find a sample of my works on links under my photo.
